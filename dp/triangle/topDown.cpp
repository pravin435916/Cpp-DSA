// 2. Time Complexity of the Top-Down Approach (with memoization):
// In the top-down recursive approach with memoization, we store the result of each subproblem in a memo array. This avoids redundant calculations since each subproblem is computed only once.

// The memoization ensures that each position triangle[row][col] is processed only once, and its result is reused for future calculations.
// The size of the memo array is proportional to the number of elements in the triangle, which is n(n + 1) / 2 (the total number of elements in the triangle), where n is the number of rows.
// Thus, the time complexity of the top-down approach with memoization is:

// O(nÂ²), since we visit each element of the triangle once and perform constant time operations for each element.
